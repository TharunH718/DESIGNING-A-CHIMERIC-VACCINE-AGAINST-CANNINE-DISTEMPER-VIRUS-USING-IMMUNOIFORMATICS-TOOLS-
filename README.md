#  DESIGNING A CHIMERIC VACCINE AGAINST CANNINE DISTEMPER VIRUS USING IMMUNOINFORMATICS TOOLS

## Project Overview: This project uses an immunoinformatics approach, also known as reverse vaccinology, to design a multi-epitope chimeric vaccine against the highly contagious Canine Distemper Virus (CDV). CDV is a virus that affects dogs and other animals, targeting their respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems, and is often fatal with a high mortality rate. The study focuses on two key surface proteins of the virus, 
Hemagglutinin (H) and Nucleocapsid (N), as the target candidates for the vaccine. The report details the use of various bioinformatics tools and databases to identify, screen, and link these epitopes to create a single vaccine construct. The ultimate goal is to create a safer, more stable, and more effective vaccine than traditional methods by eliminating the risks associated with using the whole virus.

## Key Features: 
Target Proteins: The vaccine design focuses on the Hemagglutinin (H) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins of the Canine Distemper Virus. The H protein is crucial for viral entry into host cells, while the N protein is a highly conserved region, making both excellent targets.
Reverse Vaccinology Approach: The project employs an in-silico, or computational, method called reverse vaccinology to design a multi-epitope vaccine. This approach aims to create a vaccine that is antigenic, non-allergenic, and non-toxic, reducing the time and cost associated with traditional vaccine development.
Epitope Selection and Design: The study identified and selected 13 cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes and 12 helper T-lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes based on criteria such as antigenicity, non-toxicity, and their ability to induce interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³). These epitopes were linked together using 
AAY and GPGPG linkers to create a multi-epitope vaccine construct. An adjuvant (50S ribosomal protein) and an EAAAK linker were also added to enhance the immune response.In-silico Analysis and Validation: The designed vaccine construct underwent a series of computational analyses to validate its properties and potential effectiveness:
Physicochemical Properties: Tools like ProtParam were used to determine the vaccine's molecular weight, stability index, and solubility. The instability index of 30.94 and a solubility score of 0.5389 indicated the vaccine is stable and soluble.
Structure Prediction: The secondary structure was predicted using the PSIPRED server , while the three-dimensional (3D) tertiary structure was modeled and validated using MolProbity, with a Ramachandran plot showing that 94.61% of amino acids are in the favorable region.Molecular Docking: Molecular docking simulations with the HADDOCK server demonstrated a strong binding affinity between the vaccine construct (MEV) and crucial immune receptors like Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) and Major Histocompatibility Complexes (MHCs).
Immune Simulation: The C-ImmSim server was used to simulate the immune response, which showed that the vaccine could elicit a robust immunogenic response by stimulating various immunoglobulins, B cells, and T cells, as well as producing critical cytokines.
Codon Optimization: The JCAT server was used to optimize the vaccine codons for expression in E. coli with a high Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) of 1.0 and a GC content of 51.30%, indicating a high probability of successful protein expression.
Safety and Efficacy: The designed vaccine aims to eliminate the risks of reversion to virulence and other side effects associated with traditional vaccines. It is expected to be more stable, easier to transport, and capable of generating a targeted and robust immune response
