#  DESIGNING A CHIMERIC VACCINE AGAINST CANNINE DISTEMPER VIRUS USING IMMUNOINFORMATICS TOOLS
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project uses an immunoinformatics approach, also known as reverse vaccinology, to design a multi-epitope chimeric vaccine against the highly contagious Canine Distemper Virus (CDV). CDV is a virus that affects dogs and other animals, targeting their respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems, and is often fatal with a high mortality rate. The study focuses on two key surface proteins of the virus, 
Hemagglutinin (H) and Nucleocapsid (N), as the target candidates for the vaccine. The report details the use of various bioinformatics tools and databases to identify, screen, and link these epitopes to create a single vaccine construct. The ultimate goal is to create a safer, more stable, and more effective vaccine than traditional methods by eliminating the risks associated with using the whole virus.

## Key Features: 
Target Proteins: The vaccine targets two key proteins of the Canine Distemper Virus (CDV): Hemagglutinin (H) and Nucleocapsid (N). These proteins were chosen because they are critical for viral entry and are highly conserved.
Vaccine Design: The project uses immunoinformatics and reverse vaccinology to design a multi-epitope vaccine. This computational approach avoids the risks of traditional vaccines, such as allergenicity and toxicity. The final construct links 13 CTL and 12 HTL epitopes with AAY and GPGPG linkers and includes a 50S ribosomal protein adjuvant.
In-silico Validation: The designed vaccine was extensively analyzed using bioinformatics tools:
Physicochemical Properties: Analysis showed the vaccine is stable (instability index of 30.94) and soluble (solubility score of 0.5389).
Structure and Docking: The 3D structure was modeled and validated, showing high quality with 94.61% of amino acids in the favorable region. Molecular docking confirmed a strong binding affinity to the TLR4 and MHC immune receptors.
Immune Simulation: The C-ImmSim server predicted that the vaccine would elicit a robust immune response, generating a rise in T cells, B cells, and various antibodies and cytokines.
Codon Optimization: Codons were optimized for expression in E. coli, resulting in a high Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) of 1.0 and a GC content of 51.30%.
